I'm a data scientist who lives and works in San Francisco. My focus is on modern data science workflows (primarily in R), reproducible research, and efficient code.

My language of choice for data science is R due to its functional nature and outstanding workflow capabilities of `tidyverse` + `RStudio` combination. I also use Python, but for different purposes.

Currently, I am employed by @Twitter in the @MoPub organization, where I work on improving our mobile advertising exchange.
