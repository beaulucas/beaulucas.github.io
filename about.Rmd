I'm a data scientist who lives and works in San Francisco. My focus is on modern data science workflows, reproducible research, and efficient code.

I utilize both R and Python for data science. I gravitate towards R due to its functional nature, non-standard evaluation, reproducibility, and outstanding workflow integration of `tidyverse` + `RStudio`. 

Currently, I am employed by @Twitter in the @MoPub organization, where I work on improving our mobile advertising exchange.
